1. Project: Analyze User Behavior and Activity Trends
   Goal: To determine user engagement, most active users, and topics of interest in the community.
   Tasks:
   a. Identify the most active users based on posts (questions and answers), comments, and post history.
   b. Determine the most frequent tags used in questions and analyze their popularity.
   c. Identify the average response time for questions to receive an accepted answer.
   d. Calculate the average score of users' posts and compare it with their activity levels.

2. Project: Analyze Post Quality and Effectiveness
    Goal: To determine key factors of high-quality posts and their impact on the community.
    Tasks:
    a. Identify high-scoring questions and answers to determine what makes them stand out (e.g., longer text, more detailed explanations, specific tags).
    b. Analyze the correlation between favorite counts and views, scores, or other post attributes.
    c. Investigate how long it takes for highly scored answers to be accepted compared to lower scored ones.
    d. Examine the relationship between a user's reputation and the quality of their posts (i.e., score, view count, favorite count).

3. Project: Analyzing Voting Patterns
   Goal: To explore user voting behavior and its impact on the community.
   Tasks:
   a. Calculate the average number of upvotes and downvotes per user.
   b. Identify users with the highest ratio of upvotes to downvotes and vice versa.
   c. Analyze the correlation between a post's score and the total number of upvotes and downvotes it receives.
   d. Determine the vote distribution across various post types (questions and answers).
   e. Study the relationship between user reputation, upvotes, and downvotes.

4. Project: User Demographics Analysis
   Goal: To investigate the characteristics of the community members and how they relate to user activity and contribution.
   Tasks:
   a. Group users by location and analyze their contribution patterns in terms of posts, comments, and votes.
   b. Examine the relationship between user age and activity levels (e.g., posts, comments, votes).
   c. Investigate the correlation between user reputation and their profiles' view counts.
   d. Analyze the connection between having a profile image or a filled "about me" section and user engagement.
   e. Explore the relationship between a user's website link, reputation, and their overall contribution to the community.

5. Project: Content Lifecycle Analysis
   Goal: To examine the evolution of content quality and user interactions over time.
   Tasks:
   a. Analyze the change in average post scores (questions and answers) over time to identify trends in content quality.
   b. Study the patterns of comment count, answer count, and view count for posts over time.
   c. Determine the average time between post creation and the first edit, linking the information from post_history.
   d. Investigate if there's a relationship between the presence and timing of an answer's first edit and the likelihood of that answer being accepted.

6. Project: Growth Metrics and User Retention
   Goal: To identify key factors affecting user engagement and retention in the community.
   Tasks:
   a. Compute user cohort analysis based on the registration date, comparing activity levels (posts, comments, votes), reputation growth, and other metrics across cohorts.
   b. Identify factors contributing to increased levels of user activity, such as specific tags, frequent interactions with particular users, or topics related to the user's location.
   c. Analyze the impact of accepted answers, high-scoring posts, and comments on user retention.
   d. Investigate how user-generated content (e.g., questions, answers, and comments) evolves over time, exploring patterns such as changes in topic preferences and content quality.

7. Project: Real-time Analytics Dashboard
   Goal: Design a data pipeline to feed a real-time analytics dashboard displaying community activity.
   Tasks:
   a. Design and implement a change data capture (CDC) mechanism to monitor changes in the source tables (e.g., new posts, votes, or comments).
   b. Process and aggregate the captured data in near real-time, considering factors such as rolling windows, trend analysis, and streaming computations.
   c. Create an advanced SQL-based solution to analyze the processed data and produce key KPIs for the real-time dashboard (e.g., active users, recent high-scoring posts, trending tags).
   d. Optimize the queries and the database schema for real-time analytics, covering indexing strategies, query optimizations, and materialized views.

8. Project: Data Warehouse and BI Reporting
   Goal: Develop a data warehouse schema and ETL process for extensive reporting and analysis.
   Tasks:
   a. Design a star or snowflake schema that supports extensive analytical queries based on the provided tables (facts and dimensions).
   b. Implement an ETL process to transform, cleanse, and load data from the source tables into the data warehouse, handling incremental updates and managing historical changes (e.g., slowly changing dimensions).
   c. Develop advanced SQL queries for common reporting scenarios, such as period-over-period comparisons, top-N analysis, and segment analysis.
   d. Optimize the data warehouse schema for query performance, covering partitioning strategies, indexing, and materialized views.
